ðŸ“Š Factory & Device Performance Dashboard â€“ Tableau
This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard for analyzing unhealthy device counts across factories and device types. The visualization helps in identifying critical areas for improvement in production and device management.

ðŸ”‘ Key Features
Factory Analysis (Sheet 1)

Bar chart comparing unhealthy device counts across different factories (e.g., Daikibo-Berlin, Daikibo-Shenzhen, etc.).

Highlights which factories report higher unhealthy device counts.

Device Type Analysis (Sheet 2)

Bar chart comparing unhealthy device counts by device type (AirW, CNC, Conveyor, Furnaces, Heavy, Laser, Metal, Spot, etc.).

Provides insight into which devices contribute most to unhealthy counts.

Dashboard Layout

Combined view of Factory-wise and Device-wise unhealthy counts.

Interactive and scalable for further analysis.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
Tableau Public for data visualization

Dataset includes Factory names, Device Types, and Unhealthy Device counts

ðŸ“Œ Use Case
This dashboard helps operations and quality control teams to:

Identify factories with high unhealthy device counts

Monitor device categories contributing to inefficiency

Support data-driven decisions for maintenance & production improvements
